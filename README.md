# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Issue
This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS with flexbox.  The issue involves unexpected behavior that prevents the correct application of Tailwind CSS classes and results in incorrect layout.

## Bug Description
Two divs are intended to be displayed side-by-side using Tailwind's flexbox utility classes. However, due to an unknown issue, only one div renders correctly. The other div renders either below or without applying the intended styling.

## Solution
The solution involves a deeper examination of the parent div's styling.  It's important that the parent element has the necessary flexbox properties set properly to correctly manage the child elements' layout.
